# LLM inference performance validation with vLLM on the AMD Instinct MI300X accelerator

## Overview üéâ
--------

vLLM is a toolkit and library for large language model (LLM) inference and serving. It
deploys the PagedAttention algorithm, which reduces memory consumption
and increases throughput by leveraging dynamic key and value allocation
in GPU memory. vLLM also incorporates many recent LLM acceleration and
quantization algorithms. In addition, AMD implements high-performance custom
kernels and modules in vLLM to enhance performance further.

This Docker image packages vLLM with PyTorch for an AMD Instinct‚Ñ¢ MI300X
accelerator. It includes:

-   ‚úÖ ROCm‚Ñ¢ 6.2
-   ‚úÖ vLLM 0.4.3
-   ‚úÖ PyTorch 2.4 
-   ‚úÖ Tuning files (.csv format)

With this docker image, the users can quickly validate expected inference performance numbers on the MI 300 accelerator. 
We also provide tips and techniques so that users can get optimal performance with popular AI models.


## Reproducing benchmark results üöÄ
-----------------------------

Use the following instructions to reproduce the benchmark results on an
MI300X accelerator with a prebuilt vLLM Docker image.

### NUMA balancing setting

To optimize performance, disable automatic NUMA balancing. Otherwise, the GPU
might hang until the periodic balancing is finalized. For further
details, refer to the [AMD Instinct MI300X system optimization](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/how-to/system-optimization/mi300x.html#disable-numa-auto-balancing) guide.

```sh
# disable automatic NUMA balancing
sh -c 'echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/numa_balancing'
# check if NUMA balancing is disabled (returns 0 if disabled)
cat /proc/sys/kernel/numa_balancing
0
```

### Download the Docker image üê≥

The following command pulls the Docker image from Docker Hub and
launches a new Docker instance (*vllm\_mi300x*).

```sh
docker pull rocm/pytorch-private:20240828_exec_dashboard_unified_vllm_v7 # TODO: update to the final public image
docker run -it --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --group-add video -p 8080:8080 --shm-size 16G --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --security-opt apparmor=unconfined --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE -v $(pwd):/workspace --env HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE=/workspace --name unified_docker_vllm rocm/pytorch-private:20240828_exec_dashboard_unified_vllm_v7
```

### LLM performance settings

Some environment variables enhance the performance of the vLLM kernels
and PyTorch's tunableOp on the MI300X accelerator. 
The docker image is already preconfigured to include the performance settings. 
See the [AMD Instinct MI300X workload optimization](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/how-to/tuning-guides/mi300x/workload.html) guide for more information.

### Multiprocessing distributed executor

To optimize vLLM performance, We recommend using multiprocessing API server argument. Adding the `--distributed-executor-backend mp` does so.

### Copy the repository from GitHub

Copy the performance benchmarking scripts from GitHub to a local directory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/seungrokj/unified_docker_benchmark_public # TODO: this repo will be also available at https://github.com/ROCm/MAD soon
cd unified_docker_benchmark_public
```

### Methodology

Use‚ÄØthe following command and variables to run the benchmark tests.

#### Command

```sh
./vllm_benchmark_report.sh -s $test_option -m $model_repo -g $num_gpu -d $datatype
```

-   Note: The input sequence length, output sequence length, and tensor parallel (TP) are already configured. You don't need to specify them with this script.

-   Note: If you encounter this error, you need to pass your access-authorized huggingface token to the gated models.
```sh
OSError: You are trying to access a gated repo.

# pass your HF_TOKEN
export HF_TOKEN=$your_personal_hf_token
```

#### Run the benchmark tests on the MI300X accelerator üèÉ

Here are some examples and the test results:

-   Benchmark example - latency
 
Use this command to benchmark the latency of the Llama 3.1 8B model on one GPU with the float16 data type.

```sh
./vllm_benchmark_report.sh -s latency -m meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct -g 1 -d float16
```

You can find the latency report at *./reports_float16/ Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct_latency_report.csv*.

-   Benchmark example - throughput

Use this command to benchmark the throughput of the Llama 3.1 8B model on one GPU with the fp16 data type.

```sh
./vllm_benchmark_report.sh -s throughput -m meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct -g 1 -d float16
```

You can find the throughput report at *./reports_float16/ Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct_throughput_report.csv*.

-   throughput\_tot = requests \* (**input lengths + output lengths**) / elapsed\_time

-   throughput\_gen =¬†requests \* **output lengths** / elapsed\_time
